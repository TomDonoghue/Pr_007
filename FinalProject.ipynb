    "### Many cities and neighbourhoods in the United States, such as Los Angeles have been designed for extensive car use. While these models might have worked in the past, this dynamic is beginning to change as the result of overpopulation, rideshares and automation among other factors. Urban neighborhoods are no longer just places of living for large amounts of people, but rather an intertwined mesh of commercial activity, transport and residences (3). This does not fit the originally intended model - it is not efficient, causes pollution, and prevents children from being able to play in the streets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In Barcelona(2), city planners realized this problem and implemented a system where they blocked off certain urban areas to vehicle traffic, opening them up for commercial and community use. The results were astounding - with an increase shown in community engagement along with a decrease in pollution. Economic benefits have also been shown for the local businesses in these \"superblocks\" (4,5). As a result, we have decided to create a model that can figure out the best blocks to block out for such activity, geospatially and temporally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### We will be using the number of restaurants, coffee shops, bars and transit stations to categorize the 'walkability' of different blocks, building a model analagous to walkscore (1). Furthermore, we will be using the Yelp API to temporally analyze foot traffic based on numbers and timing of reviews and checkins.\n",
